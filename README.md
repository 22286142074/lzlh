# Impersonator++
**Liquid Warping GAN with Attention: A Unified Framework for Human Image Synthesis**, including 
human motion imitation, appearance transfer, and novel view synthesis. Currently the paper is under review of 
IEEE TPAMI. It is an extension of our previous ICCV project [impersonator](https://github.com/svip-lab/impersonator), 
and it has a more powerful ability in generalization and produces higher-resolution results  (512 x 512, 1024 x 1024) than the previous ICCV version.


All codes are under cleaning, and we will released all codes and pre-trained models as soon as possible.
Besides, we further develop a GUI application to make it easier to use.
